A huge portion of the population of our country is living under poverty line and they do not have adequate capacity to cope with extreme weather events such as severe cold waves. And so every year thousands of underprivileged people suffer badly from the harsh winter.

 <br>From the last three years Prochesta Foundation has distributed winter cloths among over 2000 families. This year we are also going to help 500 families with a blanket each in the North zone of our country, where Winter is more harsh than any other place of our country. You can provide a helping hand by donating us to distribute warm clothes among them. After the collection period, the donation will be used to buy 500 blankets and will be distributed among the North Bengal.
